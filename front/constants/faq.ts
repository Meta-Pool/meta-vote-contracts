        title: 'Why do you need Meta Yield if there are launchpads for NEAR and Aurora (Skyward, BocaChica, SmartPad, etc.)?',
        text: `Launchpads are not fulfilling the same goals as Meta Yield. They are different approaches. For us a launchpad that is focused on trading NEAR for another project token is not much different then swapping them on a DEX/AMM. 
        <br><br>
        Meta Yield works as a fundraising mechanism where people can support crypto projects without losing their tokens. We want to build a long term commitment relationship (don't worry it is not marriage) between NEAR token holders and projects. 
        <br><br>
        We believe that supporting projects with NEAR staking rewards is the best way: this offers a long term view on building utility for a project's token instead of just trading it for short term value creation.
        <br><br>
        Besides supporting a project on Meta Yield, NEAR tokens from the backers will make the network more decentralized and censorship-resistant.

        PembRock is not another Decentralized Exchange (DEX): PembRock Finance is the first leveraged yield farming project on NEAR! 
        <br><br>
        Lenders earn passive income by depositing their crypto into the vaults which fund liquidity pools, while yield farmers can maximize their profits by opening a leveraged position. 
        <br><br>
        Farming is still in an early stage of development on NEAR Protocol. Supporting this project can open new opportunities to the community, giving different ways to participate in decentralized finances.

        text: `Our approach and strategy is to put NEAR token holders front and center on every product we build on top of a liquid staking asset.

        Meta Yield allows NEAR token holders to diversify the benefits of staking their assets and leverage Meta Pool's liquid token stNEAR to give them exposure to new projects coming into the NEAR and Aurora ecosystems.
        <br><br>
        They get to keep their NEAR and support projects or platforms that they believe can bring value to the NEAR Protocol network by only giving away the staking rewards generated by their NEAR token in exchange for the project's tokens.
        <br><br>
        Meta YieldÂ´s goal is to increase the value of the ecosystem and the network by supporting the security and censorship resistance of the NEAR blockchain through staking and for projects to receive NEAR staking rewards.

        title: `Don't you think a 12 month locking period is being too long given the rather difficult market situation?`,
        text: `Yes, the current market situation is rather difficult. But at the end of the day, like in any financial asset allocation, you need to think and define your objectives, their time-line, and your risk acceptance level. 
        <br><br>
        Personal Finance 101: the less the risk is, the longer the lock period or the less is the benefit.
        <br><br>
        In general and specifically in the current context, launchpad and DEX/AMM can be quite risky for crypto asset owners. 
        <br><br>
        Meta Yield offers a different approach. Meta Yield allows NEAR token holders to diversify the benefits of staking their assets and leverage Meta Pool's liquid token stNEAR to get exposure to new projects coming into the NEAR and Aurora ecosystems with a zero-risk: only the staking rewards of the committed stNEAR are used to back the projects. 
        Backers get all their $NEAR tokens (minus the staking rewards) back after the 12 months lock period (which is quite a short lock period when talking about Personal Finance 101)
        <br><br>
        So if you believe in NEAR in the long term and you have DYOR on the project you want to back, this shouldn't be a problem.

        title: `What will happen to the project that is being funded if the price of the NEAR token drops a lot?`,
        text: `The funding goals set up by the project are set in $NEAR / stNEAR. So the successful closing of a fundraising campaign is totally independent from the USD value of the $NEAR token.
        <br><br>
        And like for any regular market, timing is a success factor. But the right/perfect timing is rarely, not to say never, attained. 
        <br><br>
        However the project has 2 options to redeem the financial support obtained through the fundraising campaign:
        - Get the staking rewards upfront at a discounted rate. 
        - Wait for the lock period to end before receiving the staking rewards. 
        <br><br>
        This gives the project the opportunity to somehow time the market and eventually wait for better times in terms of USD value of the $NEAR token.

        text: `
        The $NEAR token price and the locking/unlocking of $NEAR tokens on Meta Yield are a priori 2 totally unrelated events for the following reasons:
        <br><br>
        <ol style="margin-left: 20px">
            <li>The amount of NEAR tokens can be large but not significant compared to the total market cap of NEAR</li>
            <li>The value of NEAR Protocol, ergo its $NEAR token price, goes way beyond projects fundraising on a launchpad like Meta Yield.</li>
        </ol>
        Another way to formulate the question is using the analogy with a simple case of staking/unstaking on Meta Pool: what happens tomorrow if a whale unstakes thousands of $NEAR? <br> 
        Nothing unless that whale sells-off all its $NEAR tokens.

        title: `What or who determines the amount of tokens to receive for my stNEAR deposited?`,
        text: `It is determined by Meta Pool's protocol for liquid staking.
        <br><br>
        There is a ratio of exchange from $NEAR tokens to stNEAR tokens, and this ratio changes every epoch measured in the NEAR Network.
        <br><br>
        The stNEAR:NEAR tokens ratio grows according to the network staking APY, this is the fundamental mechanism of Meta Pool.
        <br><br>
        But because Meta Pool is accruing the NEAR tokens paid as rewards from single validators, your amount of stNEAR is not increasing.
        <br><br>
        For example, you liquid stake tokens when the value of 1 stNEAR is 1,06 NEAR. With this ratio, by liquid staking 10 $NEAR tokens, you get 9,434 stNEAR tokens. 
        <br><br>
        Since the value of stNEAR in relation to $NEAR is constantly increasing, after a while having 9,434 stNEAR you will get more $NEAR tokens. Letâ€™s say the stNEAR: NEAR ratio has increased and now 1 stNEAR equivalent to 1,08 NEAR. This means that now, your 9,434 stNEAR are worth 10,19 $NEAR (9,434*1,08 = 10,19).
