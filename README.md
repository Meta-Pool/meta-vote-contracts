# Meta Vote Contract

![Meta Vote Logo](media/logo.png)

Implementation of a general voting system for metapool.app DAO using the mpDAO token.

## Versions

The last version of the deployed contract, in Near `mainnet`, is in the `main` branch.

Current stable version: [**v0.1.1**](https://github.com/Meta-Pool/meta-vote-contracts/releases/tag/v0.1.1)
Check all releases in [Meta Vote Releases](https://github.com/Meta-Pool/meta-vote-contracts/releases).

To get the stable version, run the commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Meta-Pool/meta-vote-contracts
cd meta-vote
git fetch origin --tags

git checkout tags/v0.1.1 -b stable
```

## Type Notation

```rs
// use near_sdk::json_types::U128;

pub type VoterId = near_sdk::AccountId;
pub type VotingPower = u128;
pub type Days = u16;
pub type Meta = near_sdk::Balance;
pub type ContractAddress = near_sdk::AccountId;
pub type VotableObjId = String;
pub type EpochMillis = u64;
pub type PositionIndex = u64;

pub struct LockingPositionJSON {
    pub index: Option<PositionIndex>,
    pub amount: U128,
    pub locking_period: Days, // unbonding period in days
    pub voting_power: U128,
    pub unlocking_started_at: Option<EpochMillis>,
    pub is_unlocked: bool,
    pub is_unlocking: bool,
    pub is_locked: bool,
}

pub struct VotableObjectJSON {
    pub votable_contract: String,
    pub id: VotableObjId,
    pub current_votes: U128
}
```

## Deploying a new instance of Meta Vote

```rs
pub fn new(
    owner_id: AccountId,
    min_locking_period: Days,
    max_locking_period: Days,
    min_deposit_amount: U128,
    max_locking_positions: u8,
    max_voting_positions: u8,
    meta_token_contract_address: ContractAddress,
) -> Self;
```

The best way to deploy Meta Vote is using the scripts for `mainnet` and `testnet`:

- [main_deploy.sh](contract/scripts/main_deploy.sh)
- [test_deploy.sh](contract/scripts/test_deploy.sh)


## Deposit & Locking

* Use ft_transfer_call on mpDAO token NEP-141 contract, in the `msg` field set the number of days for the unbonding period

* to see how this contract process deposits check `fn ft_on_transfer()`

## Getting a list of paginated Voters

Getting all the voters with pagination using `testnet`:

```rs
NEAR_ENV=testnet near view metavote.testnet get_voters '{"from_index": 0, "limit": 100}'
```

## View Contract Functions

```rs
pub fn get_voters(&self, from_index: u32, limit: u32) -> Vec<VoterJSON>;

pub fn get_balance(&self, voter_id: VoterId) -> U128;

pub fn get_locked_balance(&self, voter_id: VoterId) -> U128;

pub fn get_unlocking_balance(&self, voter_id: VoterId) -> U128;

pub fn get_available_voting_power(&self, voter_id: VoterId) -> U128;

pub fn get_used_voting_power(&self, voter_id: VoterId) -> U128;

pub fn get_locking_period(&self) -> (Days, Days);

pub fn get_all_locking_positions(
    &self,
    voter_id: VoterId
) -> Vec<LockingPositionJSON>;

pub fn get_locking_position(
    &self,
    index: PositionIndex,
    voter_id: VoterId
) -> Option<LockingPositionJSON>;

pub fn get_total_votes(
    &self,
    contract_address: ContractAddress,
    votable_object_id: VotableObjId
) -> U128;

// votes by app (contract)
// returns [[votable_bj_id, vote_amount],[votable_bj_id, vote_amount]...]
pub fn get_votes_by_app(&self, app_or_contract_address: String) -> Vec<(String, U128String)>;

pub fn get_votes_by_voter(
    &self,
    voter_id: VoterId
) -> Vec<VotableObjectJSON>;

pub fn get_votes_for_object(
    &self,
    voter_id: VoterId,
    contract_address: ContractAddress,
    votable_object_id: VotableObjId
) -> U128;
```

## Mutating Contract state

```rs
// *************
// * Unlocking *
// *************

pub fn unlock_position(&mut self, index: PositionIndex);

pub fn unlock_partial_position(&mut self, index: PositionIndex, amount: U128);

// ***********
// * Re-Lock *
// ***********

pub fn relock_position(
    &mut self,
    index: PositionIndex,
    locking_period: Days,
    amount_from_balance: U128
);

pub fn relock_partial_position(
    &mut self,
    index: PositionIndex,
    amount_from_position: U128,
    locking_period: Days,
    amount_from_balance: U128
);

pub fn relock_from_balance(
    &mut self,
    locking_period: Days,
    amount_from_balance: U128
);


// ************
// * Withdraw *
// ************

#[payable]
pub fn withdraw(
    &mut self,
    position_index_list: Vec<PositionIndex>,
    amount_from_balance: U128
);

#[payable]
pub fn withdraw_all(&mut self);

// **********
// * Voting *
// **********

pub fn vote(
    &mut self,
    voting_power: U128,
    contract_address: ContractAddress,
    votable_object_id: VotableObjId
);

pub fn rebalance(
    &mut self,
    voting_power: U128,
    contract_address: ContractAddress,
    votable_object_id: VotableObjId
);

pub fn unvote(
    &mut self,
    contract_address: ContractAddress,
    votable_object_id: VotableObjId
);
```

## Locking, re-locking, Unbonding process

To Lock funds into the Meta Vote contract, the user must define an amount in the $mpDAO token and a number of days (between 30 and 300 days) as the unbonding period.

![Locking and Unbonding](media/process.png)

## Consider:

- To reclaim the mpDAO tokens, you will have start the unbonding and then wait the unbonding period.

- During the unbonding period, you can not vote and you will not get paid. 

- During the unbonding period, you can chose to re-lock the tokens to be able vote and get paid again. After the voting is over, you can also chose to continue the unbonding process where you left.
